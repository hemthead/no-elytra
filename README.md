# No Elytra
Elytra travel with rockets is heavily punished in the overworld, limited in the nether, and completely fine in the end

Using rockets while gliding gives:
- 10 damage (out of world damage)
- hunger 15 for 15 seconds
- blindness 75 for 30 seconds (in overworld only)

# Misc.
I made this datapack for a server my friend was running. It's licensed MIT so feel free to fork it, use it, or whatever.
